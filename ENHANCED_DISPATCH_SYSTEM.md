# Enhanced Dispatch System Documentation

## Overview

The Enhanced Dispatch System provides advanced polygon-based zone management with configurable concentric ring dispatch, dynamic fare expansion, and intelligent driver allocation for the TaxiBook platform.

## Key Features

### 1. Polygon Zone Management
- **Polygon Support**: Zones can be defined using polygon coordinates for precise geographical boundaries
- **Ray Casting Algorithm**: Accurate point-in-polygon detection for precise zone matching
- **Centroid Calculation**: Automatic polygon centroid calculation for distance-based operations
- **Priority-based Matching**: Zones are matched based on priority order for overlapping areas

### 2. Configurable Concentric Ring System
- **Ring Parameters**: Each zone has configurable ring settings:
  - `number_of_rings`: Number of concentric rings (1-5)
  - `ring_radius_meters`: Base radius for each ring in meters
  - `ring_wait_time_seconds`: Wait time before expanding to next ring
  - `expansion_delay_sec`: Delay between ring expansions

### 3. Enhanced Dispatch Engine
- **Progressive Ring Expansion**: Searches for drivers in concentric rings around pickup location
- **Distance-based Sorting**: Drivers are sorted by proximity within each ring
- **Zone Expansion**: Automatic expansion to nearby zones when no drivers are found
- **Extra Fare Calculation**: Dynamic fare calculation for zone expansion scenarios

### 4. Intelligent Driver Assignment
- **Automatic Zone Assignment**: Drivers are automatically assigned to zones based on GPS location
- **Availability Checking**: Real-time verification of driver availability and online status
- **Ride Conflict Prevention**: Prevents assignment of drivers already assigned to other rides

## Database Schema Enhancements

### Zone Table Updates
```sql
-- New columns added for enhanced ring configuration
ALTER TABLE zone ADD COLUMN ring_radius_meters INTEGER DEFAULT 1000;
ALTER TABLE zone ADD COLUMN ring_wait_time_seconds INTEGER DEFAULT 15;
```

### Zone Model Properties
- `polygon_coordinates`: JSON array of [lat, lng] coordinate pairs
- `number_of_rings`: Number of concentric rings (1-5)
- `ring_radius_km`: Base radius for rings in kilometers
- `ring_radius_meters`: Base radius for rings in meters
- `ring_wait_time_seconds`: Wait time per ring in seconds
- `expansion_delay_sec`: Delay between ring expansions
- `priority_order`: Zone priority for overlapping areas

### Ride Model Enhancements
- `dispatch_zone_id`: Initial zone where ride was dispatched
- `dispatched_ring`: Ring number where driver was found
- `zone_expansion_approved`: Customer approval for zone expansion

### Basic Zone Creation
```python
zone = Zone(
    zone_name="Koramangala",
    polygon_coordinates=[
        [12.9300, 77.6200],
        [12.9400, 77.6200],
        [12.9400, 77.6300],
        [12.9300, 77.6300]
