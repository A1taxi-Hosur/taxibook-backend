# Production Admin Login Fix

## Issue Identified
The production admin user "developer" was created manually with an incorrect password hash format. The app expects Werkzeug's scrypt format, but the production database had a different hash format.

## Root Cause
When you manually created the admin in production:
- Username: `developer`
- Password: `Ricco123`
- Hash format: Different from Werkzeug's expected format

## Solution
You need to update the production admin password hash to use the correct Werkzeug format.

### Step 1: Connect to Production Database
In your Railway database console, run this SQL command:

```sql
UPDATE admin 
SET password_hash = 'scrypt:32768:8:1$[generated_hash]'
WHERE username = 'developer';
```

### Step 2: Get the Correct Hash
Run this in your development environment to generate the proper hash:

```python
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash
password_hash = generate_password_hash('Ricco123')
print(password_hash)
```

### Step 3: Alternative - Use Admin Panel
1. Login to development admin panel (admin/admin123)
2. Go to admin management (if available)
3. Create new admin with proper hashing
4. Copy the hash to production

## Hash Format Comparison
- **Expected (Werkzeug)**: `scrypt:32768:8:1$salt$hash`
- **Your production**: Different format (not Werkzeug compatible)

## Why Driver Works
Drivers are created through the app interface, which uses the correct `set_password()` method with proper Werkzeug hashing.

## Prevention
Always create admin users through the application interface or use the proper `set_password()` method to ensure compatible hash formats.
