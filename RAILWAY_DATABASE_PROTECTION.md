# Railway Database Protection - Preventing Production Data Loss

## Problem Solved
The Railway production database was being reset on every deployment because the app was running database initialization code that's meant for development only.

## Solution Implemented
Modified `app.py` to detect the environment and only run database initialization in development:

### Environment Detection
```python
is_production = os.environ.get('RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT') or os.environ.get('NODE_ENV') == 'production'
```

### Development vs Production Behavior

**Development (Replit):**
- Runs `db.create_all()` to create tables
- Creates default admin user if missing
- Initializes default data (fares, zones, promo codes)

**Production (Railway):**
- Only runs `db.create_all()` (safe - won't drop existing data)
- Skips all data initialization
- Preserves existing production data

## Railway Environment Variables
Railway automatically sets `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` when running on their platform. You can also set `NODE_ENV=production` if needed.

## Migration from Development to Production
When first deploying to Railway:
1. Ensure your production database is properly set up
2. Import any necessary initial data manually through admin panel
3. The production environment will maintain this data across deployments

## Database Safety Features
- `db.create_all()` is safe in production - it only creates missing tables
- No data initialization runs in production
- Production data is preserved across deployments
- Development and production databases remain completely separate

## Testing the Fix
After deployment:
1. Add real drivers, customers, and rides in production
2. Deploy a new version from GitHub
3. Verify all production data remains intact
