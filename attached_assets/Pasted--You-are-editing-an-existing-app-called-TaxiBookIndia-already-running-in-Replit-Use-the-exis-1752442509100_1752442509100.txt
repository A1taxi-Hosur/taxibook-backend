Your task is to **add new features and screens** as per the updated plan for **A1 Taxi Hosur Dev**, without touching or breaking the existing dashboard, login, rides, fare config, or driver/customer tabs.

     - Edit or delete zone
   - Optional: View zones on map using Google Maps Embed or Leaflet.js
   - Backend API: `/admin/api/zones`

5. **Fare Matrix**

   - Tabs:
     - Regular Fares (linked to existing `/admin/fare_config`)
     - Airport
     - Rental
     - Outstation
   - Each tab pulls from `/admin/api/special_fare_config`
   - Editable fields:

   - Pulls data from `/admin/api/live_driver_locations` every 10 seconds
   - Display pins for each driver:
     - Use marker color based on `driver.company_name` (e.g., Red, Blue, Green)
     - Tooltip/hover = `Driver Name, Phone, Car Type, Company, Zone`

üé® Design & Layout Notes:
- Match the style of `admin/rides.html` and `admin/fare_config.html`
- Use Bootstrap cards and tables where possible
- Use modal popups for:
  - Assign Driver
  - Edit Zone
  - Edit Special Fare

---

üîß Backend Integration:
- All APIs already exist in the updated backend:
  - `/admin/api/special_fare_config`
  - `/admin/api/zones`
  - `/admin/assign_driver`
  - `/admin/get_ride_details/<ride_id>`
- Use AJAX (`fetch`) or form submit to interact with these routes.

---

üö´ DO NOT:
- Modify existing `dashboard.html`, `rides.html`, `fare_config.html`, etc.
- Change login routes or templates

‚úÖ DO:
- Extend `base.html` to include new links: Bookings, Ongoing, History, Zones, Fare Matrix, Live Map
- Create new templates cleanly inside the `admin/` folder
- Use existing Flask `render_template()` and Jinja2 patterns

---

‚úÖ Final Checks:
- All templates load with sample data
- Admin can assign driver from Bookings tab
- Fare Matrix is editable
- Zone screen shows list + edit form
- Rides correctly flow from Bookings ‚Üí Ongoing ‚Üí History
- Live Map shows drivers and updates every 10 sec
