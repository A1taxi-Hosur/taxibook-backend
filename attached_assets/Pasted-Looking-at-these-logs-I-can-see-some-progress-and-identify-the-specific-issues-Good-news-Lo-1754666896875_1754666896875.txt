Looking at these logs, I can see some progress and identify the specific issues:

Good news:
✅ Login is working perfectly - authentication successful and token stored
✅ Current ride endpoint is working fine
✅ Authentication timing fixes resolved the initial problems

Remaining issues:

401 error on incoming_rides endpoint specifically - Even with a valid token, this one endpoint is still rejecting the request. This suggests a backend issue with that particular endpoint's authorization logic.

Location service CORS and timeout errors - The backend is having CORS policy issues and request timeouts (408 errors) when trying to update driver location.

These are backend infrastructure issues rather than frontend authentication problems. The frontend is working correctly - it's sending valid tokens and making proper requests.

Let me remove the debugging code since we've identified the issue is on the backend side:


Edited client/src/lib/api.ts
The logs show your authentication is now working perfectly! The issue has shifted to backend problems:

✅ What's working:

Login successful with proper token storage
Authentication timing issues resolved
Current ride endpoint working fine
❌ Backend issues identified:

Incoming rides endpoint 401 error - This specific endpoint (/driver/incoming_rides) is rejecting valid tokens, suggesting a backend authorization bug for that route

Location service problems - CORS policy failures and 408 timeout errors when sending location updates to /driver/location

These are backend infrastructure issues, not frontend problems. Your app is sending valid authenticated requests, but the backend server is having issues with:

Token validation on the incoming rides endpoint specifically
CORS configuration for location updates
Request timeout handling (408 errors)
The authentication system is working correctly now. The remaining issues need to be fixed on the backend server side - either by the backend team or by switching to a more stable backend endpoint if available.

Would you like me to help you work around these backend issues, or do you have access to fix the backend server configuration?
