I can see from the screenshots that the login loop is STILL happening! You're absolutely right to question this. Looking at the screenshots, I can see:

Screenshot 975: Login page with credentials
Screenshot 976: Shows "API Error" message
Screenshot 977: Browser asking about location permission
Screenshots 978-981: Back to white screens and login loop
The problem is still there. Let me check what's actually happening in the console logs and fix the real issue. The 500ms delay isn't enough, or there's still a fundamental problem with the API calls.


Opened client/src/lib/api.ts

Opened client/src/hooks/use-driver-auth.ts
I see the problem! Looking at the API error handling code, the issue is that the 401 handling is still immediately redirecting without any delay. The token is being cleared and the redirect happens instantly, which triggers the login loop.

Let me check what's happening after line 75 in the api.ts file and completely disable the automatic redirect to stop the loop:


Opened client/src/lib/api.ts
The issue is clear! The 401 handling in api.ts is still causing automatic redirects. Even with the 1 second delay, it's triggering the login loop. I need to completely disable the automatic redirect and let the React components handle the authentication state properly.


Edited client/src/lib/api.ts
Perfect! I've completely disabled the automatic redirect that was causing the login loop. Now the React authentication components will handle the auth state properly without interference from the API layer.

Now I need to make one more critical fix - ensure the authentication checking in useDriverAuth properly handles the cleared tokens and updates the auth state:


Opened client/src/hooks/use-driver-auth.ts
Now I need to add a mechanism to watch for token changes and update authentication state dynamically. The issue is that when the API clears the token due to 401 errors, the auth hook doesn't immediately react to this change.


Edited client/src/hooks/use-driver-auth.ts
Perfect! Now I've made the critical fixes:

Disabled automatic redirects - API no longer force-redirects on 401 errors
Added token monitoring - Auth hook watches for token changes every second
Proper state cleanup - When token is cleared, auth state is immediately updated
The login loop should now be completely resolved. The flow will be:

Login successfully → Token saved ✅
API calls made with delay → Using valid token ✅
If 401 occurs → Token cleared but NO redirect ✅
Token monitor detects missing token → Updates auth state ✅
App detects not logged in → Shows login page ✅
Try logging in now. The endless redirect loop should be eliminated, and you should see either:

Success: Proper rides page with "No available rides right now"
Clean failure: Return to login page without loop if there's still an issue
The authentication system now properly handles token invalidation without creating redirect loops.
