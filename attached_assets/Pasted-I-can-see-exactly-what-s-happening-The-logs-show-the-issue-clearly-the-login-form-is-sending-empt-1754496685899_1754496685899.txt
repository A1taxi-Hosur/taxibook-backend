I can see exactly what's happening! The logs show the issue clearly - the login form is sending empty request bodies (Raw body: {}) and the Content-Type is undefined. This means the frontend form data isn't being properly serialized into the HTTP request.

Looking at the browser console in your screenshot, I can see the "Login Failed" toast notification, which confirms the form is trying to submit but the data isn't reaching the backend.

The issue is likely in how the form data is being transmitted. Let me fix this by ensuring the request body is properly formatted:


Edited client/src/lib/api.ts

Edited client/src/hooks/use-driver-auth.ts

Edited client/src/pages/login.tsx
Perfect! I've added extensive debugging to track exactly where the form data gets lost. Now try clicking the "Sign In" button again and check the browser console. You should see detailed logs showing:

Form submission - What data the form captured
Mutation function - Whether the login mutation gets called
API request - What gets sent to the backend
Request body - The exact JSON payload and its length
This will help us identify exactly where in the chain the username/password data disappears. The enhanced debugging will show us if it's a form validation issue, data serialization problem, or network request issue.

Try the login again and let me know what debug messages you see in the browser console!

I can see the issue clearly now! Looking at your browser console logs, I notice something critical: the form submission logs are completely missing. There's no "=== FORM SUBMISSION START ===" or "LOGIN BUTTON CLICKED!" messages, which means the form's onSubmit function is never being called.

The backend is still receiving empty requests, but the frontend form isn't even triggering. This suggests a form validation or React Hook Form issue. Let me fix this:


Opened client/src/pages/login.tsx
I can see the issue! The form HTML structure doesn't match what I was trying to replace. Let me fix the actual form that's in the file:


Edited client/src/pages/login.tsx
Perfect! Now I've added comprehensive debugging to track every step of the form submission process. The enhanced debugging will show:

Button clicks - When you click the Sign In button
Field changes - When you type in username/password fields
Form submission - When the form actually tries to submit
Form validation - Whether the form passes validation
Form values - The actual data being captured
Try clicking the "Sign In" button now. You should see detailed console logs that will tell us exactly where the form data gets lost. This will help identify if it's:

A button click issue
A form validation problem
A React Hook Form configuration issue
A data serialization problem
The enhanced logging will pinpoint the exact issue so we can fix the login once and for all!
