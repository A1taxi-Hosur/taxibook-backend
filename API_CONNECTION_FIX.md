# **ðŸ”§ Frontend API Connection Fix**

## **Issue Identified**
The frontend driver app is making requests to the wrong endpoint:

**Frontend calling**: `/login`  
**Backend endpoint**: `/driver/login`

This causes a 404 Not Found error and CORS issues.

## **Console Log Analysis**
```javascript
Making API request to: https://[domain]/login  // WRONG
// Should be: https://[domain]/driver/login
```

**Error Messages:**
- `404 Not Found` - Endpoint doesn't exist
- `CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check`
- `408 Request Timeout` - Request fails due to wrong endpoint

## **Fix Applied**
Added a legacy compatibility route in `app.py` that forwards `/login` requests to the driver login handler:

```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def legacy_login():
    """Legacy login endpoint that redirects to driver login for backwards compatibility"""
    from routes.driver import login
    return login()
```

## **Testing the Fix**
```bash
# Test the /login endpoint (frontend route)
curl -X POST "https://[domain]/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"DRVVJ53TA","password":"6655@Taxi"}'

# Test the /driver/login endpoint (original route)  
curl -X POST "https://[domain]/driver/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"DRVVJ53TA","password":"6655@Taxi"}'
```

Both should now return the same successful login response.

## **Expected Result**
The frontend login should now work properly:
1. Frontend sends request to `/login`
2. Backend forwards to driver login handler
3. Authentication succeeds with proper JSON response
4. Frontend navigates to dashboard

## **Status**
Fix implemented - testing to confirm frontend can now login successfully.
