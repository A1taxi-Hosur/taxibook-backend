# Driver Logout & Location Tracking Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Ghost Driver Problem ✅
**Problem**: Drivers remained visible on live map after logout with old locations
**Solution**: 
- Clear location data (`current_lat`, `current_lng`, `location_updated_at`) on logout
- Reset zone assignment and `out_of_zone` status
- Prevents ghost drivers from appearing at old positions

### 2. Always Available Issue ✅
**Problem**: Logged-out drivers still received ride requests
**Solution**:
- Added `is_online` status check in `/incoming_rides` endpoint
- Offline drivers now get empty ride list with "Driver is offline" message
- Proper enforcement of online/offline status

### 3. Location Staleness Detection ✅
**Problem**: No expiration for old location data, causing outdated positions
**Solution**:
- Added 15-minute staleness threshold in live map API
- Stale offline drivers are filtered out completely
- Stale online drivers shown with semi-transparent markers
- Added "Last Seen" timestamp in map info windows

## Implementation Details

### Driver Logout Changes
```python
# Clear all location data on logout
driver.is_online = False
driver.current_lat = None
driver.current_lng = None  
driver.location_updated_at = None
driver.zone_id = None
driver.out_of_zone = False
```

### Ride Availability Check
```python
# Only online drivers receive ride requests
if not driver.is_online:
    return create_success_response({
        'rides': [],
        'count': 0
    }, "Driver is offline - no rides available")
```

### Staleness Detection
- **Fresh locations**: Show normally with full opacity
- **Stale locations (>15 min)**: 
  - Offline drivers: Hidden completely
  - Online drivers: Semi-transparent markers
- **Last seen timestamps**: Displayed in info windows
