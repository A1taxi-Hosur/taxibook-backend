# **üîç Driver Login Issue - Credential Problem**

## **Issue Identified**
User trying to login with username `DRVMQ102` but this driver account doesn't exist in the database.

## **Database Check Results**
```sql
SELECT id, name, username, phone FROM driver WHERE username = 'DRVMQ102';
-- Result: No records found
```

This means the username `DRVMQ102` is not registered in the system.

## **Available Working Credentials**
Based on previous successful tests, these credentials work:
- **Username**: `DRVVJ53TA`
- **Password**: `6655@Taxi` 
- **Driver**: Ricco

## **Solution Options**

### **Option 1: Use Existing Working Credentials**
Try logging in with: `DRVVJ53TA` / `6655@Taxi`

### **Option 2: Create New Driver Account**
If you need the `DRVMQ102` account, I can create it through the admin panel with proper credentials.

### **Option 3: Check All Available Drivers**
I can list all driver accounts to see what usernames are available.

## **Password Format**
Driver passwords follow the format: `[last 4 digits of phone]@Taxi`

## **Next Steps**
1. Try the working credentials: `DRVVJ53TA` / `6655@Taxi`
2. Or let me create a new driver account if needed
3. Or check what driver accounts exist in the database

The backend authentication system is working perfectly - the issue is simply that `DRVMQ102` isn't a registered driver account.
