# Driver Login Guide

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING

The driver login system is fully functional and working correctly. Both test drivers can log in successfully.

## Login Credentials Format

### Username
- Use the **auto-generated username** (not the phone number)
- Example: `DRVVJ53TA`, `DRVQG01KC`

### Password
- Format: `{last 4 digits of phone}@Taxi`
- Example: If phone is 9988776655, password is `6655@Taxi`

## Current Active Drivers

| Driver Name | Username | Phone | Password |
|-------------|----------|-------|----------|
| jai | DRVQG01KC | 9597230958 | 0958@Taxi |
| Ricco | DRVVJ53TA | 9988776655 | 6655@Taxi |

## Login API Endpoint

```
POST /driver/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "DRVVJ53TA",
  "password": "6655@Taxi"
}
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Invalid Username or Password
**Problem**: Error message "Invalid username or password"
**Solution**: 
- Check that you're using the **username** (not phone number)
- Ensure password format is correct: `{last4digits}@Taxi`
- Username is case-sensitive

### 2. Account Not Setup
**Problem**: "Account not properly setup. Contact admin."
**Solution**: Admin needs to create/reset the driver account with proper credentials

### 3. Login Successful Response
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Login successful",
  "data": {
    "driver_id": 20,
    "name": "Ricco",
    "phone": "9988776655",
    "username": "DRVVJ53TA",
    "is_online": true,
    "car_make": "Maruti",
    "car_model": "Ciaz",
    "car_number": "TN29AQ1288",
    "car_type": "sedan",
    "car_year": 2003
  }
}
```

## Admin Actions

### Creating New Driver
When admin creates a new driver:
1. Username is auto-generated (format: DRV + random 5 chars)
2. Password is auto-generated using phone number format
3. Driver can immediately log in with these credentials

### Resetting Driver Password
Admin can reset driver password, which regenerates it using the phone number format.

## Testing Verification

✅ All driver login tests pass
✅ Both active drivers can log in successfully
✅ Password format validation working
✅ Complete driver data returned on successful login

## Troubleshooting

If driver still cannot log in:
1. Verify the exact username from admin panel
2. Confirm phone number is correct
3. Try the password format exactly: `{last4digits}@Taxi`
4. Check that the driver account was properly created by admin

The system is working correctly - the issue is likely incorrect credentials being used.
