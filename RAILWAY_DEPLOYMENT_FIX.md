# Railway Deployment - Google Maps API Fix

## Problem
Google Maps works perfectly in Replit but fails when deployed to Railway because Railway uses different environment variables.

## Root Cause
- **Replit**: Uses Replit Secrets with working key `AIzaSyBIt8z_VD5s9lo8RpDKdJVhqgtwn0zVBBo`
- **Railway**: Reads from .env file or Railway environment variables
- **Current .env**: Has wrong key `AIzaSyDw7eAaQOKVOrurvnqTyR6yK3tDdXnjsFk`

## Solution - Set Railway Environment Variables

### Method 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your app service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add environment variable:
   - **Name**: `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `AIzaSyBIt8z_VD5s9lo8RpDKdJVhqgtwn0zVBBo`

### Method 2: Railway CLI
```bash
railway variables set GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyBIt8z_VD5s9lo8RpDKdJVhqgtwn0zVBBo
```

### Method 3: Update .env for GitHub (Less Secure)
Update your .env file before pushing to GitHub:
```env
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyBIt8z_VD5s9lo8RpDKdJVhqgtwn0zVBBo
```

## Other Environment Variables for Railway

Make sure these are also set in Railway:
- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: Generate a secure secret key for production
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your production PostgreSQL database URL
- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `production`

## Production Security Notes
- Never commit API keys to GitHub
- Use Railway environment variables for all secrets
- The working API key has proper billing and permissions enabled
- Consider creating a separate API key for production if needed

## Verification Steps
After deploying to Railway:
1. Check Railway logs for Google Maps API calls
2. Test ride estimate API endpoint
3. Verify no "REQUEST_DENIED" or "BILLING_NOT_ENABLED" errors
4. Confirm distance calculations use real Google Maps data (not fallback)

## Expected Results
- ✅ Railway deployment uses correct Google Maps API key
- ✅ Distance Matrix API returns 200 OK responses
- ✅ Real distance calculations (no fallback system)
- ✅ All customer APIs work with authentic Google Maps data
